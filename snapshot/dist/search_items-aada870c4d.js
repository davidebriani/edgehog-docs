To better illustrate this, we will use as example the ACME Inc company, which manages a fleet of e-bikes and electric scooters. We will illustrate the hierarchy going from the bottom up, showing how each concept relates to the other ones. Hardware Type An Hardware Type represents the electronic hardware components embedded in an Appliance. As an example, a possible Hardware Type description could be &quot;ESP32 with a GSM module&quot; or &quot;RaspberryPi 0 with an LTE modem&quot;. Each Hardware Type can have one or more Hardware Type Part Numbers associated with it. This makes sure that the user is able to map, e.g., a new revision of the PCB to the same Hardware Type, since different hardware with the same Hardware Type is assumed to be compatible. Usually (but not necessarily) the Hardware Type Part Number is a code that is written on the PCB. Device A device is an entity connected to Astarte. A Device has a uniquely identified by its Device ID, and it usually lives inside an Appliance (if it is not on a shelf or in a repair shop). Note that an Appliance is not tied to a specific device forever: using the bike sharing analogy, a physical e-bike is the appliance, the device is the board which connects it to Astarte. If the board breaks, it is possible that the e-bike is sent to a repair shop to replace it with a new one. In that case, the Appliance would stay the same (since the physical bike is always the same), but it will be associated with a new Device. Moreover, the old Device could actually be repaired and assigned to a new Appliance. Appliance Models An Appliance Model constitutes a group of Appliances implementing the same functionality for some users. Two different appliances can be physically identical and still belong to different Appliance Models, since they can have different software running on them. An Appliance Model is associated with a specific Hardware Type, so two Appliances implementing the same functionality but using different Hardware Types will belong to two different Appliance Models. This makes it so that the Appliance Model is the fundamental identifier when it comes to software updates. An Appliance Model has one or more Appliance Model Part Numbers asociated with it, allowing to track newer versions of an appliance which do not change its main functionality (e.g. a new e-bike model using brakes from a different vendor). Usually (but not necessarily) the Appliance Model Part Number is written on the Appliance itself, or on the box containing it. Drawing again from our bike sharing example, e-bikes and electric scooters would represent two different Appliance Models, even if they use the same Hardware Type (e.g. an ESP32 with a GSM module). It is also possible that the e-bikes are further split into different Appliance Models depending on the country they are deployed in if, for example, the software has to conform to speed limitations which are specific for each country.","ref":"core_concepts.html#hardware-types-devices-and-appliance-models","title":"Core concepts - Hardware types, Devices and Appliance Models","type":"extras"},{"doc":"For each hardware type the following information can be displayed and edited.

Say, for example, that two different models of e-bikes are sent to maintenance; if they share the same hardware, the working PCB board of one model could be fitted into the other one. For this reason, each time a Device connects to Astarte, it can notify Astarte about the Appliance Model it is plugged into, exposing its Part Number.

Each Edgehog tenant is mapped to an Astarte Realm, and it owns the credentials to interact with all the Realm APIs for that specific Realm. Edgehog Astarte Interfaces The interaction between Edgehog and Astarte is defined by a set of interfaces that define which data is sent both from Edgehog to the Devices and from the Devices towards Edgehog. Additionally, connection and disconnection triggers ar installed in the Astarte Realm, and point to the triggers endpoint of the Edgehog tenant. Astarte AppEngine API The REST API is called every time Edgehog needs to retrieve data contained in an Astarte interface or when it needs to send data to the Devices. In the first case, Edgehog issues a GET HTTP request to retrieve the data from AppEngine API, which reads the data from the Astarte database. When Edgehog needs to send data towards a Device instead, it sends a POST HTTP to AppEngine API, which takes care of delivering data via MQTT to the device. Astarte Triggers Astarte Triggers are used to update the online state of the device. Each time a Device connects or disconnects from Astarte, Astarte Trigger Engine sends an HTTP POST request to the Edgehog backend, which in turn updates the Device online status in its own database.","ref":"overview.html#device-interaction-through-astarte","title":"Architecture overview - Device interaction (through Astarte)","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Edgehog's interaction is logically divided amongst two main entities: devices and users.

However, some standard interfaces are already supported by Edgehog in order to provide useful functionalities, such as device geolocation. Hence, data that devices send via Edgehog's Astarte Interfaces are automatically understood, collected and reported by Edgehog. Publishing info about the Appliance Each Device is supposed to notify Astarte, e.g. on each connection, about the Appliance Model it is plugged into. To do so, the Device can use the io.edgehog.devicemanager.ApplianceInfo Astarte Interface to specify: the Serial Number: a code that uniquely identifies the Appliance the Part Number: a code that uniquely identifies the Appliance Model When exposing the Part Number, Edgehog can associate the Device to the correct Appliance Model by matching the Device's Part Number with the ones of the registered Appliance Model. Publishing info about the hardware Each Device can notify Astarte about the general capabilities of the Device. These info are hardware-related and are usually not intended to change over time. A Device can expose this set of data via the io.edgehog.devicemanager.HardwareInfo Astarte Interface. Publishing info about the Device status To expose info about its current status or measured data, some additional Astarte Interfaces are already defined for Edgehog.

Delivered data is kept for 5184000 seconds before it is erased from the database. /systemStatus/uptimeMillis Get time in milliseconds since boot This endpoint accepts values of type longinteger : a signed 64 bit integer (please note that longinteger is represented as a string by default in JSON-based APIs.).

Thanks to this type of interface, the device can send a mutable, ordered stream of data, with no concept of persistent state or synchronization. Data gets sent with an object aggregation. Astarte expects the owner to send all of the interface's mappings at the same time, packed in a single message. Mappings The interface has the following mappings: /ap/channel with integer type. The channel over which the client is communicating with the access point. /ap/essid with string type. Extended Service Set Identification of the current AP, empty string if the AP is hidden. /ap/macAddress with string type. Lower case mac address string formatted like de:ad:be:ff:11:22 . /ap/rssi with integer type. The current signal strength measured in dBm. /ap/channel The channel over which the client is communicating with the access point. The channel represents one of the ranges into which the reference frequency is divided and it's identified by an integer number in the range 1 - 165, depending on the frequency itself and the region.
